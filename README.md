# 👋 Hi, I'm Juli3nd!

## 🚀 About Me

I'm a curious and methodical tinker-er, blending my day job as a **History Teacher** with a deep passion for **sysadmin/dev work**, hardware, and networking. Whether I'm optimizing my digital environment, exploring storage solutions, or connecting devices, I'm always on the lookout for technical challenges that push me to learn and improve.

- 🛠️ **Favorite Projects:** wintutil from CTT and anything that lets me dive deep into hardware or network optimization.
- 🧠 **Skills:** Storage, networking, device automation, and squeezing the most out of my digital setup.
- 🏫 **Background:** Secondary school teacher by profession, amateur sysadmin/dev by obsession.

## 🏗️ What I Love

- Building, fixing, and optimizing tech—especially at the hardware and network level
- Sharing knowledge and helping others get the most from their digital tools
- Bridging the gap between history and technology

## 🌱 Currently Exploring

- New ways to automate my workflow and home network
- Open source tools for monitoring, backups, and device management
- Creative intersections between education, history, and technology
